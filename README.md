# Password Generator
**Python Random Password Generator**\
*Created By James Rupa*

## Project Description

Quick and simple project that uses the random library in python to generator a password based on what the user wants. They are able to choose whether they want to include symbols, capital letters, and numbers and are able to set the length of the password. The password is then generated randomly based on what the user chooses to include in their password. Hope you enjoy, this was a quick project and really easy for beginners to learn.

## Added Functions

We now have added md5 hashing that the user is able to choose the phrase they want to convert to 128 bit hexadecimal.
